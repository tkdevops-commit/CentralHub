# productisuite

ProductiSuite is a small scaled personal project web-based application build aimed at optimizing employee productivity by integrating key functionalities from data aggregated across various business applications into a single access point. This application enables employees to effectively manage tasks, compute date intervals, and record essential information in real-time, thereby streamlining workflows, ensuring accuracy and enhancing overall operational efficiency. Built only in vanilla stack using HTML, CSS and JS.

Features

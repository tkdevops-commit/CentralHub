# productisuite

ProductiSuite is a small scaled personal project web-based application build aimed at optimizing employee productivity by integrating key functionalities from data aggregated across various business applications into a single access point. This application enables employees to effectively manage tasks, compute date intervals, and record essential information in real-time, thereby streamlining workflows, ensuring accuracy and enhancing overall operational efficiency. Built only in vanilla stack using HTML, CSS and JS.

Features
- Task Management: Efficiently manage and prioritize tasks.
- Date Interval Computation: Calculate date intervals seamlessly.
- Real-Time Information Recording: Record and access essential information in real-time.
- Workflow Streamlining: Simplify and automate workflows for improved efficiency.
- Calendar binding: Mark calendar days for payment scheduling or other features. 

This project is freely available for sharing and use. I encourage individuals and organizations to leverage ProductiSuite to enhance their productivity and efficiency. Feel free to use, modify and distribute the code as needed.
